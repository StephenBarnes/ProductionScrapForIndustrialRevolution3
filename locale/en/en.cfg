[mod-setting-description]
ProductionScrapForIR3-scrap-per-ingredient=How many scrap items should be produced per ingot (or ingot equivalent) in a recipe. See mod page for details. Setting this above 0.25 is not recommended as it allows you to get free resources by scrapping and remaking items. Setting to zero disables these scrap byproducts completely.
ProductionScrapForIR3-add-pellet-recipes=Adds assembler recipes that turn scrap into pellets. If this is disabled, scrap can only be smelted into ingots. If this is enabled, you can still smelt scrap to ingots, but you can also send some of the scrap to other manufacturing processes, such as for shotgun ammo or sulfuric acid. This creates an optional logistics challenge, which rewards you with savings in resources and energy.
ProductionScrapForIR3-pellets-from-scrap=How many pellets each unit of scrap can be converted into, if the recipes are enabled above. If this is 4, the only benefit of these new recipes is that they avoid re-smelting to ingots. Setting this to 5 gives a small material bonus over smelting the scrap.
