[mod-setting-description]
ProductionScrapForIR3-scrap-per-ingredient=How many scrap items should be produced per ingot (or ingot equivalent) in a recipe. See mod page for details. Setting this above 0.25 is not recommended as it allows you to get free resources by scrapping and remaking items. Setting to zero disables these scrap byproducts completely. Also note that this setting is reduced by TODO % for recipes that can use productivity modules, to avoid creating a situation where you can get free resources by scrapping and remaking items.
ProductionScrapForIR3-scrap-stack-size=Use this to make it harder or easier to transport scrap around in trains. In default IR3, the stack size is 100; this setting overrides that.
ProductionScrapForIR3-scrap-processing-recipe=Adds assembler recipes that turn scrap into pellets, or pellets and rivets. If this is set to "none", scrap can only be smelted into ingots. Otherwise, you can still smelt scrap to ingots, but you can also send some of the scrap to other manufacturing processes. This creates an optional logistics challenge, which rewards you with savings in resources and energy.
ProductionScrapForIR3-pellets-from-scrap=How many pellets each unit of scrap can be converted into, if the recipes are enabled above. If you've set the scrap processing recipe above to "scrap => pellets", then setting this number to 4 will make it so the only benefit of these new recipes is that they avoid re-smelting to ingots, and setting this to 5 gives a small material bonus over smelting the scrap. If you've set the scrap processing recipe to "scrap => pellets + rivets", then a reasonable value for this setting is 2. Setting this number too high will allow you to get free resources by scrapping and remaking items. Setting this number to a fractional value will cause the recipe to produce a random number of pellets averaging to at most this setting.
ProductionScrapForIR3-rivets-from-scrap=How many rivets each unit of scrap can be converted into, if you have set the scrap processing recipe above to "scrap => pellets + rivets". A reasonable value for this setting is 1.5. Setting this number too high will allow you to get free resources by scrapping and remaking items. Setting this number to a fractional value will cause the recipe to produce a random number of rivets averaging to at most this setting.
