[mod-setting-description]
ProductionScrapForIR3-scrap-per-ingredient=How many scrap items should be produced per ingot (or ingot equivalent) in a recipe. See mod page for details. Setting this above 0.25 is not recommended as it allows you to get free resources by scrapping and remaking items. Setting to zero disables these scrap byproducts completely.
ProductionScrapForIR3-exclude-annoyances=If enabled, you won't get scrap when crafting things like your personal armor, vehicles, night vision equipment, and other recipes that are mostly used for once-off manual crafting. For these recipes, scrap is mostly just an annoyance that you have to manually dump in a chest somewhere.
ProductionScrapForIR3-scrap-stack-multiplier=Use this to make it harder or easier to transport scrap around in trains. In default IR3, the stack size is 100 for all scrap. If you set this setting to 0.5, you will need twice as many train wagons to transport your scrap.
ProductionScrapForIR3-scrap-processing-recipe=Adds assembler recipes to turn scrap into pellets, or pellets and rivets. If this is set to "None", scrap can only be smelted into ingots. Otherwise, you can still smelt scrap to ingots, but you can also send some of the scrap to other manufacturing processes. This creates an optional logistics challenge, which rewards you with savings in resources and energy.
ProductionScrapForIR3-pellets-from-scrap-without-rivets=How many pellets each unit of scrap can be converted into, if no rivets are produced. This is the case if you've enabled the scrap-to-pellet recipes above. Setting this number to 4 will make it so the only benefit of these new recipes is that they avoid re-smelting to ingots, and setting this to 5 gives a small material bonus over smelting the scrap.
ProductionScrapForIR3-nerf-scrapping-for-analysis-packs=Reduces the scrap produced when you put science packs into IR3's scrapping machines. This is recommended because analysis-pack production can use productivity modules, and we want to avoid creating a way for the player to get free resources by scrapping and remaking analysis packs forever.
